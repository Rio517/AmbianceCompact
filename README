This is a compressed version of the default Lucid Lynx theme to conserve space on your desktop, but still maintain it's attractiveness. As much as I like to default theme, it drops a lot of unnecessary space on padding and big buttons.

Installation:

Download a tarball: http://github.com/Rio517/AmbianceCompact/tarball/master

If you have git installed, you can clone the repo: git clone http://github.com/Rio517/AmbianceCompact.git

Then place the AmbianceCompact directory you've unpacked/downloaded into ~/.themes
